# Farzad resource list
A curated list of resources on computer engineering that helped me in my on-going journey!

## Contributing
Any suggestion is appreciated as I can't wait to learn new things. Just note that, I only list resources that I have at least read through partly and feel they are worth spreading from my own point of view.
I recommend everyone to curate a list for his/her own and let others know about.
